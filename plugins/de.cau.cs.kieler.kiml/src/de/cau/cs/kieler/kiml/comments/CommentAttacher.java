/**
 * Main class of the comment attachment framework. Comment attachment infers the relation between nodes
 * marked as representing comments (through the {@link LayoutOptions#COMMENT_BOX} property) and nodes
 * they refer to. Running the framework results in edges being introduced between these pairs of nodes,
 * which allows layout algorithms to place them close to each other. Not doing this would usually lead
 * to comments and nodes not being placed close to each other, thereby breaking the visual link between
 * them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The comment attachment framework mainly consists of this class and the following interfaces to make
 * the framework customizable to each use case:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IExplicitAttachmentProvider}<br/>
 *     Some visual languages allow developers to establish explicit attachments between comments and
 *     nodes. An {@link IExplicitAttachmentProvider} knows how to retrieve such explicit attachments.
 *     Clients can configure whether the presence of explicit attachments in a diagram should disable
 *     heuristic attachments. After all, if the developer already defined some explicit attachments,
 *     chances are he wanted the other comments to be unattached.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IBoundsProvider}<br/>
 *     Comment attachment often includes looking at the size and position of comments. A bounds provider
 *     knows how to provide these information for comments and nodes.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IAttachmentTargetProvider}<br/>
 *     By default, all non-comment siblings of a comment are considered as possible attachment targets.
 *     However, implementations of this interface can be used to limit the considered attachment targets
 *     to a smaller number to achieve speedups or things. Clients usually won't need to provide a
 *     custom implementation.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IEligibilityFilter}<br/>
 *     Some comments clearly refer to a diagram as a whole. Eligibility filters filter these out to
 *     keep them from being attached to anything. Examples are comments that identify the authors of
 *     a diagram.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IHeuristic}<br/>
 *     Heuristics provide a heuristic assessment as to whether a given comment-node pair is likely to
 *     be attached or not. Heuristics can be based on a lot of different metrics, but have to provide
 *     a way of normalizing their results to {@code [0, 1]}. Attachment decisions are based on the
 *     values computed by heuristics.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IAttachmentDecider}<br/>
 *     Attachment deciders have the final say on which attachment target a comment will be attached to.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * All of the different aspects of comment attachment can be configured through the configuration
 * methods provided by this class. Each configuration method documents the default used if it is not
 * called. Most aspects provide sensible defaults, but you will want to at least take a look at the
 * following configuration methods:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link #withExplicitAttachmentProvider(IExplicitAttachmentProvider)}<br/>
 *     Even if no heuristics are configured, explicit attachments may be of interest.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link #addEligibilityFilter(IEligibilityFilter)}<br/>
 *     Filtering out standalone comments will probably be of interest.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link #addHeuristic(IHeuristic)}<br/>
 *     Heuristics are the backbone of the comment attachment framework. Unless you only want to add
 *     explicit attachments, you will want to add heuristics to base attachment decisions on.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
