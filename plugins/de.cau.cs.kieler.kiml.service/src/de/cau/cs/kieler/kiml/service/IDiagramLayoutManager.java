/**
 * Interface for managers of diagram layout. A diagram layout manager is responsible for transforming
 * the diagram contained in a workbench part into a layout graph, which is an instance of the
 * KGraph meta model. Furthermore it must handle the transfer of concrete layout data from the
 * layout graph back to the diagram after a layout has been computed.
 * <p>
 * The {@code IAdapterFactory} interface is used to access specific elements:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations of {@link de.cau.cs.kieler.kiml.config.IMutableLayoutConfig} for reading
 *     and writing layout options in a specific diagram</li>
 *   <li>Diagram parts such as GEF edit parts</li>
 *   <li>Domain model elements: {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EObject}</li>
 *   <li>Editing domains: {@link org.eclipse.emf.transaction.TransactionalEditingDomain}
 * </ul>
 * The {@link #getAdapterList()} method should return exactly one element, namely the type of
 * diagram part, which should also match the generic type of the implementation.
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of diagram part that is handled by this diagram layout manager
