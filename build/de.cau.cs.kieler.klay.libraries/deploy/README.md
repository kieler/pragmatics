Use one of these if you are using our KGraph format and want to include a single jar.

klay-nightly-<timestamp>.jar
    Bundle containing layouters klay.force, klay.layered and klay.tree with KIELER dependencies, but no EMF or Google Guava.
klay-nightly-<timestamp>-all.jar
    Same as above but with EMF and Google Guava.

If you want full control and/or use only one of the layouters, get these.
