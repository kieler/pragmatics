bundled_klay
============
Use one of these if you are using our KGraph format and want to include a single jar.

klay-VERSION.jar
    Bundle containing layouters klay.force, klay.layered and klay.tree with KIELER dependencies, but no EMF or Google Guava.
klay-VERSION-deps.jar
    Same as above but with EMF and Google Guava.

libs
====
Layouters klay.force, klay.layered, and klay.tree with all dependencies as separate jars.
If you want full control and/or use only one of the layouters, get these.

libs.zip
========
Zipped libs folder for convenient download.

libsFormatsAdditions
====================
Additionally needed jars to use our JSON importer.
If you are using JSON instead of KGraph as input format, use these together with the jars from 'libs'.

libsFormatsAdditions.zip
========================
Zipped libsFormatsAdditions folder for convenient download.
